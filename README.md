# WebEngage
Feedback page project.
1. Create a HTML Page as per the screenshot attached. This should be Mobile Responsive. Logo Image: https://app.retently.com/file/5b8f9f7051004e1d4fbf4f51-1536141011961.png

2. In the same page above, create a Javascript function which checks the browser and whether incognito mode.

3. In the same page above, if the browser is chrome and not incognito, create a function which checks the Query parameter named "ayush" in the URL of the page (which can have any value between 0 to 10), and based on the value auto-select the same radio button.

For example when the page has query parameter ?ayush=9 then the 9th Radio Button should be selected in the page.

4. Now the 9th would be selected by the function, if I manually change it to any other button, it should not change and go back to 9th, based on the URL.
